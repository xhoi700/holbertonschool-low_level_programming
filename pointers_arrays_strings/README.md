# C Programming Project

This project includes a set of tasks focused on C programming basics, including preprocessor commands, compilation steps, string manipulation functions, and assembly code generation. Each task is linked to a specific file that accomplishes the required operation.

### Task Descriptions

- **Filename: `0-preprocessor`**  
  This script runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the output to another file. It handles only the preprocessing stage of compilation, allowing for inspection of preprocessed code.

- **Filename: `0-strcat.c`**  
  Write a function that concatenates two strings. This file includes code to perform string concatenation using a custom implementation of the `strcat` function.

- **Filename: `1-strncat.c`**  
  Write a function that concatenates two strings, but only up to a specified number of bytes from the source string. This function is a customized version of `strncat`.

- **Filename: `2-strncpy.c`**  
  Write a function that copies a specified number of bytes from one string to another, emulating the functionality of the `strncpy` function.

- **Filename: `3-strcmp.c`**  
  Write a function that compares two strings lexicographically. This task requires creating a version of the `strcmp` function to compare character sequences in strings.

- **Filename: `4-rev_array.c`**  
  Write a function that reverses the contents of an integer array. This task focuses on in-place array manipulation to reverse element order.

- **Filename: `5-string_toupper.c`**  
  Write a function that converts all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase. This function iterates over characters, altering lowercase letters to uppercase.

- **Filename: `6-cap_string.c`**  
  Write a function that capitalizes all words in a string. The function will transform the first character of each word to uppercase if it is lowercase.

- **Filename: `7-leet.c`**  
  Write a function that encodes a string into "1337" (leet) speak. Specific characters are replaced with corresponding leet symbols to alter the string format.

- **Filename: `assembly_code_generator`**
